/*
  Grayscale reconstruction

  Performs a grayscale reconstruction of the `mask` image by the
  `marker` image using the sequential reconstruction algorithm of Vincent
  (1993).

  Both `marker` and `mask` should point to two-dimensional arrays of
  size (dims[0], dims[1]) with the first dimension (dims[0]) changing
  fastest. The `marker` array is updated with the result in-place.

  The algorithm alternately scans the marker image in the forward and
  reverse directions performing a partial reconstruction in each
  direction. It repeats these scans until no change is detected or
  until a maximum iteration threshold (currently 1000) is reached.
