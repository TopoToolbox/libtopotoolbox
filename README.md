# libtopotoolbox

libtopotoolbox is a C library for the analysis of digital elevation
models that powers TopoToolbox v3. It provides implementations of
fundamental algorithms for terrain analysis.

If you are primarily interested in using TopoToolbox for your work,
studies or research, you may find the [main TopoToolbox
documentation](https://topotoolbox.github.io) useful.

More information about the algorithms provided by libtopotoolbox and
how to integrate the library into your project is available in the
[documentation](https://topotoolbox.github.io/libtopotoolbox).

Bindings for libtopotoolbox in higher-level programming languages
provide a user-friendly interface to the library and enable data
import and export, visualization and interaction with the geospatial
data analysis ecosystems of those languages.
