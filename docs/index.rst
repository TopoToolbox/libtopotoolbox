libtopotoolbox
==============



libtopotoolbox is a C library for the analysis of digital elevation models that powers `TopoToolbox v3 <https://topotoolbox.github.io>`_. It provides implementations of fundamental algorithms for terrain analysis.

If you are primarily interested in using TopoToolbox for your work, studies or research, you may find the `main TopoToolbox documentation <https://topotoolbox.github.io>`_ useful.

More information about the algorithms provided by libtopotoolbox and how to integrate the library into your project is available in the `API documentation <https://topotoolbox.github.io/libtopotoolbox>`_.

Bindings for libtopotoolbox in higher-level programming languages provide a user-friendly interface to the library and enable data import and export, visualization and interaction with the geospatial data analysis ecosystems of those languages. Bindings are currently implemented for

- `MATLAB <https://github.com/TopoToolbox/topotoolbox>`_
- `Python <https://github.com/TopoToolbox/pytopotoolbox>`_
